PRIVACY POLICY
--------------

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how Ghostware (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects personal information when you use Rekcol (“Software”), our secure password manager application.

By using the Software, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Rekcol is designed with security and privacy as its top priority. The Software does not collect or transmit sensitive data to Ghostware servers. All password data is encrypted and stored locally on your device.

The Software may collect minimal technical information for licensing and functionality, including:
 - License key or activation data
 - Basic system information (e.g., OS version, device ID hash) for license validation
 - Optional crash or error logs (if you choose to send reports)

We do NOT collect:
 - Your passwords
 - Personal data stored in your password vault
 - Browsing data or external activity

2. HOW WE USE INFORMATION
The limited technical information we collect may be used to:
 - Validate your license
 - Provide software updates or support
 - Improve the performance and security of the Software
 - Communicate important information about your account or software changes

3. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY
 - All sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is encrypted locally using strong encryption standards.
 - We do not store or have access to your vault contents.
 - We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.

4. DATA SHARING
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties.  
We may disclose information only if required by law or to comply with a legal obligation.

5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
Rekcol does not integrate with third-party services by default. If optional integrations are added in the future, they will be clearly communicated and governed by their respective privacy policies.

6. USER RIGHTS
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
 - Access, correct, or delete your personal information
 - Withdraw consent where applicable
 - Request details on how your data is processed

Since Rekcol stores data locally on your device, you can control and delete your vault at any time by uninstalling the Software or using built-in vault management tools.

7. DATA RETENTION
Ghostware does not store your passwords or personal vault data. Any licensing-related data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the service or comply with legal obligations.

8. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Rekcol is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

9. POLICY UPDATES
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” and may notify you through the Software or by email. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.
