Release date: October 21, 2025

🧩 About Rekcol

Rekcol is a lightweight, secure, and privacy-focused password manager built for Windows.
It helps you safely store, view, and manage your credentials in an encrypted local database — without sending any data online.

🔐 Key Features

Local-only data storage (no cloud sync or external servers)

Strong encryption for all saved passwords

Simple, clean interface for quick access

Auto-launch option for convenience

Signed executable for authenticity

🪄 How to Install

Download Rekcol.exe from the Assets section below.

Run the installer / executable.

Follow on-screen instructions.

(Optional) Right-click and “Run as Administrator” if Windows SmartScreen asks for permission.

💡 Note: Since Rekcol is signed with a free code signature, Windows might show a SmartScreen warning the first few times — this is normal. Just choose “More Info → Run Anyway” to proceed. Future releases will build reputation over time.
